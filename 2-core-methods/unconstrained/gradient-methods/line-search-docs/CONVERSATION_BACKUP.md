```python
def backtracking_line_search(f, grad_f, x_k, d_k, alpha_init=1.0, rho=0.5, c=1e-4):
    alpha = alpha_init
    f_k = f(x_k)
    grad_k = grad_f(x_k)
    threshold = c * np.dot(grad_k, d_k)
    
    while f(x_k + alpha * d_k) > f_k + alpha * threshold:
        alpha *= rho
    
    return alpha
```

## Mathematical Concepts Covered

### Core Theory
- Descent directions: ∇f(xₖ)ᵀdₖ < 0
- Merit function: φ(α) = f(xₖ + αdₖ)
- Armijo condition: f(xₖ + αdₖ) ≤ f(xₖ) + c₁α∇f(xₖ)ᵀdₖ
- Curvature condition: ∇f(xₖ + αdₖ)ᵀdₖ ≥ c₂∇f(xₖ)ᵀdₖ
- Exact optimality: φ'(αₖ) = 0

### Convergence Theory
- Global convergence: lim ‖∇f(xₖ)‖ = 0
- Linear convergence: ‖xₖ₊₁ - x*‖ ≤ μ‖xₖ - x*‖
- Superlinear: μₖ → 0
- Quadratic: ‖xₖ₊₁ - x*‖ ≤ C‖xₖ - x*‖²
- Zoutendijk's theorem

### Practical Parameters
- Backtracking: ρ = 0.5, c = 10⁻⁴
- Wolfe (Newton): c₁ = 10⁻⁴, c₂ = 0.9
- Wolfe (CG): c₁ = 10⁻⁴, c₂ = 0.1
